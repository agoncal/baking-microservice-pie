= Invoking Micro-Services

[%step]
* We have one Number API Microservice
* We need one Book API Microservice
* Book API invokes Number API
* We have one Angular client
* We use 3 PIs
* How do we deploy and make this run?

== Architecture

image::invoking-architecture.png[]

== Invoke Microservices

* Microservices need to talk to each other
* Synchronously / Asynchronously
* REST / Messaging / Reactive
* We'll use only HTTP

== Several to choose from

[%step]
* By hand
* Apache HTTP Client
* JAX-RS Client API
* Netflix Feign

== What is Feign?

[%step]
* Feign is a Java to HTTP client
* Inspired by Retrofit, JAXRS-2.0, and WebSocket
* Reducing the complexity of HTTP APIs calls
* Jersey or CXF
* Clients for REST or SOAP services

== Book API

[%step]
* JAX-RS Endpoint
* CRUD operations on Book
* Book JPA entity
* HTTP GET/POST/PUT/DELETE on:
* `/books`
* Port 8081

== Book API

== Running on TomEE

[%step]
* TomEE = Tomcat + Java EE
* Comes from Apache
* Open source
* Supported by Tomitribe
* Executable Fat-Jar

[%step]
* Now we have
** 2 Microservices
** 1 Angular app
* All components in one file
* Easy to run in development
