* The architecture evolved thourgh demos

== One Angular app invokes a remote service

== One service needs to talk to another one

image::invoking-architecture.png[]

== We don't see anything so we add monitoring

image::monitoring-architecture.png[]

== We need to configure different environments

image::configuring-architecture.png[]

== To avoid hard coded IP addresses, we introduce a registry

image::registry-architecture.png[]

== To avoid failure, we introduce a circuit breaker

image::circuit-architecture.png[]

== To scale we add more instances and need a client load-balancer

image::scale-architecture.png[]

== We need security

image::security-architecture.png[]

== We need to handle load

image::load-architecture.png[]

== We used many micro-service design patterns

== But there are more
