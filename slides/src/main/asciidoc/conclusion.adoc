= Conclusion

== Lessons learnt

[%step]
* Micro Services are hard
* Micro Services are bloody hard
* Need to integrate with a lot of infrastucture
* Run in different environments (local, docker, pi)
* The more technologies the harder
* The more languages the harder
* The more versions the harder

== And...

[%step]
* We didn't have databases
* We didn't have a complex business logic
* We didn't have a complex network
* We didn't duplicate and load balance the registry (SPOF)
* We didn't use asynchronous events
* We didn't do integration testing
* We didn't do tracing (Zipkin)
* We didn't do rate limit on our APIs
